#Power Management Unit Introduction

The Power Management Unit _(shortened to PMU in this book)_ was designed by Drotek and released in the late 2017. Conceived to work specifically with the Pixhawk 3 PRO autopilot from Drotek, any autopilot and devices can benefit from its **double battery capacity**, providing **two 5V power supplies** or a **redundant** one for your autopilot, and adding work time to your setup, as well as its built-in high-end **voltage and current sensing** which will provide you with additional crucial **real-time flight informations**.
