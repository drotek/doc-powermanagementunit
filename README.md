#Power Management Unit User Guide

Along with the numerous drone parts Drotek is selling, Drotek has developed a couple of boards related to the power management operation inside of embedded electronics in general. At the end of this year 2017, Drotek created a new power management unit, built to provide a solid and reliable power supply for as many projects as possible.

Designed to perform with drones, it is plug-and-play with [Pixhawk 3 PRO autopilot](https://pixhawk.drotek.com/en/) that Drotek released the same year 2017.

This book is meant to provide you with all informations on how to use the Power Management Unit efficiently and what can be done with it.
